Welcome!

## Code of conduct

Be kind, research before asking/contributing.

Please remember that my time is limited and my resources are as well. Solving "nuances" will likely require external contributions but I'm happy to help and guide.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot an issue, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue.

Also use [the wiki](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/wiki) and contribute to it
